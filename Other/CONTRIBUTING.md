# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving this project! Your time and effort are greatly appreciated.

I will be forced to slow development due to school, so contributors will be invaluable.

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter a problem or have an idea for improvement, please open an issue on GitHub. Give a clear title and description so we can reproduce it. Examples include:
- "points on the graph not loading"
- "email not working for login"
