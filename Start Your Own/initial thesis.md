## Initial Trade Ideas

### Research Solutions (RSSS)

Thesis: An AI and vertical SaaS company poised for growth through its high-margin platform business. The company has demonstrated a strategic shift toward a recurring-revenue model, which has translated into significant increases in gross margin, positive net income, and record cash flow from operations. Its AI-based product, Scite, is a key growth driver, showing a growth rate over 40%.

Position: A long position with a $150 allocation.

Risk: The company's market capitalization is $118.8 million, which is well within the new universe. Its average volume of 63,316 shares and its bid-ask spread requires the use of a stop-limit order to mitigate slippage.

### Medicus Pharma (MDCX)

Thesis: A diversified biotech company with multiple clinical-stage assets targeting multi-billion dollar markets. The company has a strong cash position and is advancing its key Phase 2 programs for a non-invasive cancer treatment and a new asset for urology. The management has a clear strategy for pipeline expansion through acquisitions.

Position: A long position with a $150 allocation.

Risk: While the CEO has commented on the company's "extremely strong" fundamentals, as a clinical-stage biotech, its valuation is highly dependent on trial outcomes and regulatory approvals. The stock, with a market cap of $44.2 million, is subject to heightened volatility.

### OKYO Pharma (OKYO)

Thesis: A high-risk, high-reward biotech opportunity with recent positive clinical momentum. Its lead candidate has received FDA Fast Track designation for neuropathic corneal pain and recently posted positive Phase 2 trial results, which has been a catalyst for increased investor interest and non-dilutive funding.[15] The company has an average analyst target price of $7.00, suggesting significant upside.

Position: A long position with a $150 allocation.

Risk: As a clinical-stage company, OKYO does not have a profitable, commercial product. Its future success is contingent on the outcome of ongoing trials, which introduces significant uncertainty and potential for loss.

### Palvella Therapeutics (PVLA)

Thesis: A clinical-stage biopharma with a promising pipeline centered on its QTORIN platform, which targets rare genetic skin diseases.[15] The company has received FDA breakthrough, orphan drug, and fast-track designations for its lead candidate and has successfully completed enrollment for its Phase 3 trial.[15] This progress positions the company for a potential new drug application submission in 2026.[15]

Position: A long position with a $150 allocation.

Risk: As a clinical-stage biotech, the company's value is tied to clinical trial success. The stock, with a market cap of $416.08 million [15], can be volatile.[16]
