3. Non-Negotiable Constraints
No External Funds: The Total Equity ($618.58) must remain constant. All future trades and the cash buffer must be funded internally by selling existing holdings.

Cash Buffer is Internal: The 10% cash buffer must be maintained by selling stocks, not by adding new capital.

Next Step: When providing the next market update, please include the current CSV file or a "Daily Results" section with all the latest prices and the "Holdings" list. The system will then check if any position has deviated enough to require a new rebalance.
